# PPL_Parking-Management-System
#The problem statement involves creating a Parking Management System that efficiently handles parking for both cars and bikes. 
#The system has distinct slots for cars and bikes, tracks vehicle entry and exit times, and calculates parking fees based on the duration of stay. The code is designed using object-oriented principles, employing inheritance and polymorphism. 
#Vehicles are categorized into types (cars, bikes), and corresponding parking slots are assigned. If a slot is full, vehicles are added to a waitlist, and parking fees are calculated dynamically when a vehicle exits.
